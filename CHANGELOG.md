## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Compiled Intent Mesh (CIM)** — compile-time `skill-index.json` generation with intent keywords, adjacency graph, and chain predictions
- **intent-router hook** — UserPromptSubmit hook that auto-suggests skill routing based on prompt analysis against compiled index
- **Privacy Mesh** — three-tier pre-tool guard (ALLOW/WARN/BLOCK) with content scanning for AWS keys, GitHub tokens, Stripe keys, etc.
- **Per-project privacy config** — `.rune/privacy.json` for custom BLOCK/WARN/ALLOW patterns and elevated skills
- **Skill-aware elevation** — sentinel, review, audit bypass WARN tier; BLOCK tier cannot be bypassed
- **Split pack auto-discovery** — compiler discovers skill files from `skills/` subdir when `format: split` packs have no explicit manifest
- **550 tests** — 18 new tests for skill-index generation, hook behavior, and split pack discovery

### Fixed
- **Command injection** in `version-sync-check.js` — replaced `execSync` with `execFileSync`
- **Dynamic doctor threshold** — skill count no longer hardcoded, scans source directory
- **Split pack builds** — packs with `format: split` but no `skills:` YAML array now build correctly

### Changed
- Skill count: 60→61 (L3: +1 slides)
- Hook count: 8→10 (intent-router, pre-tool-guard rewrite)
- Pre-tool-guard: simple WARN → three-tier Privacy Mesh with content scanning

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Scripts Bundling** — compiler copies `scripts/` directories and resolves `{scripts_dir}` placeholders in skill output
- **slides** skill (L3) — presentation/slide generation utility
- **Mesh Contract** — `.rune/contract.md` enforced by cook and sentinel

### Changed
- Skill count: 59→60 (L3: 26→27)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Tier Override** — compiler resolves Pro/Business skills over Free counterparts with `discoverTieredPacks()`
- Skill-level merging for tiered packs (Pro overrides Free, Business overrides both)
- 8 tests for tier override functionality

### Changed
- Compiler emitter supports multi-tier pack resolution

## [1.5.1] - 2025-03-05

### Added
- **Agent Skills standard compliance** — adopted frontmatter fields from Anthropic's official skills spec.
- `context: fork` on all L1 orchestrators (cook, team, launch, rescue) — run in isolated subagent context.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` on side-effect skills (launch, deploy, incident) — prevents Claude from auto-triggering deployments or incident responses.
- `user-invocable: false` on internal L3 utilities (completion-gate, constraint-check, integrity-check, context-engine, scope-guard, worktree, skill-router) — Claude-only background skills.
- Dynamic context injection (`!`command``) on skill-router — injects live routing overrides and skill metrics before Claude reads the routing table.
- Pushy descriptions on all L1 orchestrators — prevents undertriggering per Anthropic's best practice.
- Explicit `skills[]` array in marketplace.json listing all 49 skill paths.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-03-05

### Added
- **logic-guardian** (L2, Quality group) — protects complex business logic from accidental AI deletion/overwrite. Maintains `.rune/logic-manifest.json`, enforces pre-edit gates, validates post-edit diffs.
- **trade-logic** skill in `@rune/trading` extension — trading-specific logic preservation: entry/exit specs, indicator parameter registry, production-backtest sync, state machine documentation, backtest result linkage.
- **docs/TRADE-MATRIX.md** — complete NxN skill-to-skill delegation matrix (4 matrices: L1->L2, L2<->L2, L1/L2->L3, L3->L3 exceptions).
- Plugin instruction feed for proactive skill usage across all projects.
- Session-start hook loads `logic-manifest.json` when present.
- CHANGELOG.md (this file).

### Changed
