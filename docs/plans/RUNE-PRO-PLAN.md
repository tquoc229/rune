```

## Brand

- Org: `rune-kit` (same GitHub org)
- Free: `rune-kit/rune` (current repo)
- Premium: `rune-kit/rune-pro` (separate repo, private until paid)
- Sub-brand: "Rune Pro" — not a separate brand, just premium tier
- npm: `@rune-pro/sales`, `@rune-pro/product`, etc.

## Technical Architecture

### How Pro packs connect to free Rune

Pro packs follow the same `PACK.md` format as free L4 extensions. When installed:

1. User runs `npx @rune-kit/rune init --pro` (or adds pro packs manually)
2. Pro packs install into `extensions/` alongside free packs
3. `cook` Phase 1.5 auto-detects them via the same trigger table
4. Pro skills can call free Rune skills (brainstorm, plan, research, etc.)
5. Free Rune skills NEVER require Pro packs — free works standalone

### Business Memory Layer

Pro packs need business context that free Rune doesn't track:

```
.rune/
├── business/
│   ├── people.md          — key stakeholders, roles, preferences
│   ├── glossary.md        — company-specific terminology
│   ├── processes.md       — business workflows and approval chains
│   └── context.md         — company info, product lines, market position
```

This extends `session-bridge` (L3) with a `business-context` sub-module.
Loaded at session start alongside technical context.

### Distribution

Option A: GitHub Sponsors + private repo access (simplest)
- User sponsors → gets GitHub collaborator access → can clone/install
- Pros: zero infrastructure, GitHub handles payment
- Cons: no license key, harder to revoke

Option B: Stripe + license key + private npm
- User pays on landing page → receives license key
- `npx @rune-kit/rune pro activate <key>` validates and installs
- Pros: proper licensing, revocable, analytics
- Cons: needs backend (small — Stripe webhook + key store)

Option C: GitHub Marketplace (future)
- When Claude Code marketplace adds payment → native distribution
- Currently NOT available (no payment mechanism as of March 2025)

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (GitHub Sponsors), migrate to B when scale justifies it.

## Priority Packs (Phase 1)

### 1. @rune-pro/product — Product Management

**Why first**: Closest to developer workflow. PM + dev overlap is huge.

Sub-skills:
- `feature-spec` — Write structured PRDs from user stories
- `roadmap` — Prioritize features with ICE/RICE scoring
- `metrics-tracking` — Define and track product KPIs
- `stakeholder-comms` — Write status updates, release notes, changelogs
- `user-research-synthesis` — Summarize user feedback into actionable insights
- `competitive-analysis` — Compare features/pricing with competitors

Workflows:
- `/product write-spec` — generate feature specification
- `/product roadmap-update` — refresh roadmap with new priorities
- `/product metrics-review` — weekly KPI dashboard update
- `/product release-notes` — auto-generate from git log

Connections to free Rune:
- Calls `plan` for implementation planning after spec
- Calls `brainstorm` for feature ideation
- Calls `research` + `trend-scout` for competitive intel
- Called by `cook` when product context needed

### 2. @rune-pro/sales — Sales Enablement

**Why second**: Revenue-generating skill. Founders/startups need this.

Sub-skills:
- `account-research` — Research prospects using public data
- `call-preparation` — Generate talking points, objection handling

Connections to free Rune:
- Calls `research` for prospect/company data
- Calls `marketing` for content alignment
- Calls `trend-scout` for market context

### 3. @rune-pro/data-science — Data Science & Analytics

**Why third**: Extends free @rune/analytics significantly.

Sub-skills:
- `data-exploration` — Profile datasets, detect patterns, suggest cleaning
- `sql-advanced` — Complex queries, CTEs, window functions, optimization
- `visualization` — Chart selection, layout, color encoding for data stories
- `statistical-testing` — Hypothesis testing, regression, significance analysis
- `dashboard-building` — Interactive dashboard architecture and implementation
- `data-pipeline` — ETL patterns, data quality gates, freshness monitoring
- `ml-evaluation` — Model performance metrics, A/B lift analysis

Workflows:
- `/data explore <dataset>` — profile and explore a dataset
- `/data query <question>` — translate natural language to SQL
- `/data dashboard <metrics>` — build analytics dashboard
- `/data significance <experiment>` — statistical significance analysis

Connections to free Rune:
- Extends `@rune/analytics` (free L4) with deeper capabilities
- Calls `plan` for dashboard architecture
- Calls `design` for visualization design tokens

## Phase 2 Packs (after Phase 1 validated)

### 4. @rune-pro/support — Customer Support

### 9. @rune-pro/enterprise-search — Cross-Platform Search
- Unified search across Notion, Confluence, Slack, Drive
- Requires MCP connectors for each platform

## Connector Architecture (MCP)

Pro packs that interact with external tools need MCP server connectors:

| Category | Tools | MCP Server |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Chat | Slack, Teams | existing community MCP servers |
| Email | Gmail, Outlook | existing community MCP servers |
| CRM | Salesforce, HubSpot | needs custom or community MCP |
| Project | Linear, Jira, Asana | existing community MCP servers |
| Knowledge | Notion, Confluence | existing community MCP servers |

**Strategy**: Don't build MCP servers. Reference existing community servers in connector setup docs. Pro packs provide the SKILLS, users bring their own CONNECTORS.

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 targets (first 3 months)
- 50+ GitHub stars on rune-pro
- 20+ paying users (sponsors or license keys)
- 3 Pro packs launched (product, sales, data-science)

### Validation signals (continue investing if)
- Users actually use Pro packs weekly (not just install)
- Feature requests come in for Pro skills (engagement signal)
- Word-of-mouth referrals (organic growth)

### Kill signals (stop if)
- < 10 paying users after 3 months
- No repeat usage after initial install
- Users can achieve the same with free tools + prompts

## Timeline

| Phase | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Phase 0 | Free Rune enhancements (design, marketing, plan, analytics) | Done |
| Phase 1a | @rune-pro/product pack | ✅ Done (PACK.md created) |
| Phase 1b | @rune-pro/sales pack | After product validated |
| Phase 1c | @rune-pro/data-science pack | After sales validated |
| Phase 2 | support, finance, legal, hr, operations | After Phase 1 revenue |
| Phase 3 | enterprise-search + full MCP connector suite | When demand justifies |
