# @rune/pack-name

## Purpose

One paragraph: what domain this pack serves, why these skills are grouped together, what developer problem it solves.

## Triggers

- Auto-trigger: when [domain-specific files/patterns] detected in project
- `/rune <command>` — manual invocation
- Called by `cook` (L1) when [domain context] detected

## Skills Included

### skill-1

Brief description of what this skill does.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — [Action]**
Concrete, executable step. Include tool names (Grep, Read, Bash) and expected behavior.

**Step 2 — [Action]**
Next step with specific details.

#### Example

```language
// Concrete code example showing the skill's output or pattern
```

### skill-2

Brief description.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — [Action]**
...

#### Example

```language
// Code example
```

### skill-3

## Constraints

1. MUST [required behavior specific to this domain]
2. MUST NOT [forbidden behavior]
3. MUST [another rule]

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| [domain-specific failure] | HIGH/MEDIUM | [how to avoid] |

## Self-Validation

Per-skill quality checks that run before reporting "done". Domain-specific — not covered by centralized completion-gate.

```
SELF-VALIDATION (per skill):
skill-1:
  - [ ] [domain-specific quality check]
  - [ ] [output format compliance]
skill-2:
  - [ ] [domain-specific quality check]
  - [ ] [completeness check]
```

## Done When

- [Verifiable condition 1]
- [Verifiable condition 2]
- [Structured output emitted]
- Self-Validation: all per-skill checks passed

## Cost Profile

Estimated token usage for pack workflow. [model] default.
