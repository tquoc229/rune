# Rune Architecture

## 5-Layer Model

| Layer | Name | Count | Can Call | Called By | State |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **L0** | **Router** | **1** | **L1-L3 (routing)** | **Every message** | **Stateless (rule-based)** |
| L1 | Orchestrators | 5 | L2, L3 | L0, User | Stateful (workflow) |
| L2 | Workflow Hubs | 26 | L2 (cross-hub), L3 | L1, L2 | Stateful (task) |
| L3 | Utilities | 23 | Nothing (pure)* | L1, L2 | Stateless |
| L4 | Extension Packs | 12 free + 1 pro | L3 | L2 (domain match) | Config-based |

### L0 — The Enforcement Layer

`skill-router` is the only L0 skill. It enforces a single discipline: **check the routing table before every response**. It doesn't do work — it ensures the right skill does the work.

- Loaded via plugin description, always active
- Routes user intent to the correct L1-L3 skill
- Prevents agents from bypassing skills ("I'll just do it manually")
- See `skills/skill-router/SKILL.md` for the full routing table and anti-rationalization gate

### L4 — Extension Packs (Activation Protocol)

L4 packs are domain-specific instruction sets stored as `extensions/*/PACK.md` files. They are activated (read) in two ways:

**1. Explicit invocation** — User runs `/rune <pack-skill>` (e.g., `/rune rag-patterns`)
   - `skill-router` detects the L4 trigger in Tier 4 routing table
   - Agent reads `extensions/<pack>/PACK.md`
   - Agent follows the matching skill's Workflow steps

**2. Implicit detection** — `cook` detects domain context in Phase 1.5
   - Scout output reveals domain signals (e.g., `three.js` in dependencies)
   - Cook matches against L4 pack mapping table
   - Agent reads matching PACK.md and applies its constraints/patterns
   - Domain patterns supplement cook's standard phases

**L4 calling rules:**
- L4 CAN call L3 utilities (scout, verification, hallucination-guard)
- L4 CANNOT call L1 or L2 skills
- L4 CANNOT call other L4 packs (no cross-pack dependencies)
- If L4 pack file not found on disk, skip silently (graceful degradation)

### Exceptions

- `team` (L1) can call other L1 orchestrators — meta-orchestration pattern.
- *L3→L3 coordination: `context-engine` → `session-bridge`, `hallucination-guard` → `research`, `session-bridge` → `integrity-check` (documented in SKILL.md).

## Mesh Protocol

### Loop Prevention

```
Rule 1: No self-calls (history[-1] !== target)
Rule 2: Max 2 visits to same skill per chain
Rule 3: Max chain depth: 8
Rule 4: If blocked → escalate to L1 orchestrator
```

### Model Auto-Selection

```
Read-only / scan?           → haiku   (cheapest)
Write / edit / generate?    → sonnet  (default)
Architecture / security?    → opus    (deep reasoning)

Override: priority=critical → always opus
Override: budget constraint → downgrade
Override: user preference   → manual in config
```

### Parallel Execution

| Context | Max Parallel | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| L3 utilities (haiku) | 5 | Cheap, fast, independent |
| L2 hubs (sonnet) | 3 | Moderate cost, may share context |
| L1 orchestrators | 1 | Only one orchestrator at a time |

### Error Handling & Resilience

| If this fails... | Try this instead... |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| debug can't find cause | problem-solver (different reasoning) |
| docs-seeker can't find | research (broader web search) |
| browser-pilot can't capture | verification (CLI checks) |
| scout can't find files | research + docs-seeker |
| test can't run (env broken) | deploy fix env → test again |
| review finds too many issues | plan re-scope → fix priorities |

## Master Plan + Phase Files (Amateur-Proof Architecture)

The `plan` skill (v0.4.0) produces structured plans designed for **any model to execute with high accuracy**.

### Design Principle

> Plan for the weakest coder. If Haiku (Amateur) can execute the phase file, every model benefits.

### Structure

```
.rune/
  plan-<feature>.md          ← Master plan: overview (<80 lines)
  plan-<feature>-phase1.md   ← Phase 1: self-contained execution detail (<200 lines)
  plan-<feature>-phase2.md   ← Phase 2: self-contained execution detail
  ...
```

### Phase File Template (Amateur-Proof)

Every phase file MUST include these 7 mandatory sections:

| Section | Purpose | Why Amateur Needs It |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Data Flow | ASCII diagram of data movement | Prevents wrong function call order |
| Code Contracts | Function signatures, interfaces | Prevents wrong return types |
| Tasks | File paths, logic, edge cases | Prevents missed files |
| Failure Scenarios | When/Then/Error table | Prevents missing error handling |
| Rejection Criteria | Explicit DO NOTs | Prevents common anti-patterns |
| Cross-Phase Context | Imports from prior, exports for future | Prevents broken dependencies |
| Acceptance Criteria | Testable conditions | Prevents "done" without proof |

### Execution Flow

```
1. cook Phase 0: check for existing master plan → resume from current phase
2. cook Phase 2: plan produces master + phase files → user approves
3. cook Phase 3-7: load ONLY current phase file → test → implement → quality → commit
4. cook Phase 7: mark phase ✅ in master plan → announce next phase
5. Next session: Phase 0 detects master plan → loads next phase → executes
```

**One phase per session = small context = better code from any model.**

## Context Bus

Each workflow maintains a shared context managed by L1:

```
L1: full bus (complete picture)
L2: relevant subset (only what they need)
L3: minimal query (stateless, no history)
L4: domain-filtered subset
```
