## Why Rune?

Most skill ecosystems are either **too many isolated skills** (540+ that don't talk to each other) or **rigid pipelines** (A → B → C, if B fails everything stops).

Rune is a **mesh** — 61 skills with 200+ connections across a 5-layer architecture. Skills call each other bidirectionally, forming resilient workflows that adapt when things go wrong.

```
Pipeline:  A → B → C → D         (B fails = stuck)
Hub-Spoke: A → HUB → C           (HUB fails = stuck)
Mesh:      A ↔ B ↔ C             (B fails = A reaches C via D→E)
           ↕       ↕
           D ↔ E ↔ F
```

## Benchmark: With Rune vs Without Rune

We ran 10 standardized coding tasks on Claude Code — once **without** Rune (vanilla), once **with** Rune — and measured tokens, cost, duration, and correctness.

### Headline Results

```
                Without Rune    With Rune     Delta
Avg Tokens:     541,400         454,491       ↓ 16%
Avg Cost:       $0.69           $0.65         ↓ 6%
Avg Duration:   2.3 min         2.1 min       ↓ 9%
Avg Tool Calls: 14              13            ↓ 7%
Correctness:    9/10            9/10          =
```

### Where Rune Shines: Complex Tasks

| Task | Difficulty | Tokens | Cost | Duration | Tools |
|------|-----------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Refactor 450-line component | Medium | **-62%** | **-17%** | **-32%** | **-27%** |
| Full feature (auth + API + tests) | Complex | **-36%** | **-29%** | **-31%** | **-27%** |
| Add Zod validation | Easy | -9% | **-28%** | **-32%** | 0% |
| Dark mode across 6 components | Hard | ~0% | +10% | -7% | -6% |

Rune doesn't make Claude smarter — Claude already knows how to code. Rune makes Claude **disciplined**. The more complex the task, the more discipline matters.

## What's New (v2.8.0)

- **Anti-Loop Intelligence** — 7 core skills enriched with execution loop detection, saturation analysis, error pattern matching, artifact folding, budget-aware progression, and recovery policy routing
- **cook v2.1.0** — observation/effect ratio tracking (detects stuck agents reading without writing) + budget-aware phase progression with hard caps on replans, quality retries, and session tool calls
- **completion-gate v1.8.0** — execution loop audit: classifies tool calls as observation vs effect, flags imbalanced ratios and repeating sequences in gate reports
- **scout v0.3.0** — info saturation detection: tracks entity discovery rate and content similarity to stop scanning when diminishing returns detected
- **research v0.4.0** — diminishing returns detection: monitors new-entity ratio and result overlap across searches to skip redundant queries
- **context-engine v0.9.0** — artifact folding: large tool outputs (>4000 chars or >120 lines) saved to `.rune/artifacts/` with compact preview in context
- **debug v1.0.0** — known error pattern catalog: 8 error archetypes (STATELESS_LOSS, MODULE_NOT_FOUND, TYPE_MISMATCH, ASYNC_DEADLOCK, etc.) with recovery hints + error fingerprinting for dedup
- **fix v0.8.0** — recovery policy matrix: classifies errors into 8 types (INPUT_REQUIRED→PROMPT_USER, TIMEOUT→RETRY, POLICY_BLOCKED→ABORT, etc.) before attempting fixes
- **Source attribution cleanup** — removed all enrichment credit lines from skill files to reduce context noise

### Previous (v2.7.0)

- **Deep Knowledge** — 8 core skills enriched with battle-tested patterns: context compaction, structured cumulative memory, milestone analysis, multi-provider adapters, AI-driven interview, prompt-as-API-contract, token budget tracking, incremental stream processing
- **946 Tests** — compiler + signals + hooks + scripts + status + visualizer validation

### Previous (v2.6.0)

- **Mesh Signals** — event-driven skill communication via frontmatter. Skills declare `emit` and `listen` signals; compiler builds a signal graph in `skill-index.json`. 17 signals across 15 core skills
- **Signal Validation** — `scripts/validate-signals.js` checks orphan listeners (hard error), unlistened emitters (warning), signal naming conventions
- **Mesh Contract** (v2.5.0) — `.rune/contract.md` project-level invariants enforced by cook + sentinel as hard gates
- **Tier Override** — Pro/Business packs override Free packs with skill-level merging
- **Scripts Bundling** — compiler copies `scripts/` directories, resolves `{scripts_dir}` placeholders

### Signal Graph

Skills communicate through declarative signals — no runtime event bus, just metadata for discovery, validation, and routing:

```
scout ──emit:codebase.scanned──→ plan, brainstorm
fix ────emit:code.changed──────→ test, sentinel, review, preflight, verification
test ───emit:tests.passed──────→ deploy
test ───emit:tests.failed──────→ debug
sentinel─emit:security.passed──→ deploy
debug ──emit:bug.diagnosed─────→ fix
deploy ─emit:deploy.complete───→ watchdog
cook ───emit:phase.complete────→ session-bridge
```

## What Rune Is (and Isn't)

Rune started as a **Claude Code plugin** and now compiles to **every major AI IDE**. Same 61 skills, same mesh connections, same workflows — zero knowledge loss across platforms.

| | Rune Provides | Claude Code Provides |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflows** | 8-phase TDD cycle (cook), parallel DAG execution (team), rescue pipelines | Basic tool calling |
| **Quality Gates** | preflight + sentinel + review + completion-gate (parallel) | None built-in |
| **Domain Knowledge** | 14 extension packs (trading, SaaS, mobile, etc.) | General-purpose |
| **Cross-Session State** | .rune/ directory (decisions, conventions, progress) | Conversation only |
| **Mesh Resilience** | 200+ skill connections, fail-loud-route-around | Linear execution |
| **Cost Optimization** | Auto model selection (haiku/sonnet/opus per task) | Single model |
| | | |
| **Sandbox & Permissions** | — | Claude Code handles this |
| **Agent Spawning** | — | Claude Code's Task/Agent system |
| **MCP Integration** | — | Claude Code's MCP protocol |
| **File System Access** | — | Claude Code's tool permissions |

### Common Misconceptions

| "Rune doesn't have..." | Reality |
|---|---|
| Task graph / DAG | `team` skill: DAG decomposition → parallel worktree agents → merge coordination |
| CI quality gates | `verification` skill: lint + typecheck + tests + build (actual commands, not LLM review) |
| Memory / state | `session-bridge` + `journal`: cross-session decisions, conventions, ADRs, module health |
| Multi-model strategy | Every skill has assigned model: haiku (scan), sonnet (code), opus (architecture) |
| Agent specialization | 61 specialized skills with dedicated roles (architect, coder, reviewer, scanner, researcher, BA, scaffolder) — each runs as a Task agent via Claude Code |
| Security scanning | `sentinel`: OWASP patterns, secret scanning, dependency audit. `sast`: static analysis |

## Install

### Claude Code (Native Plugin)

```bash
# Install via Claude Code CLI
claude plugin add rune-kit/rune
```

Or add manually in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `installed_plugins`.

Full mesh: subagents, hooks, adaptive routing, mesh analytics.

### Cursor / Windsurf / Antigravity / Any IDE

```bash
# Compile Rune skills for your platform
npx @rune-kit/rune init

# Or specify platform explicitly
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform cursor
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform windsurf
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform antigravity
```

This compiles all 61 skills into your IDE's rules format. Same knowledge, same workflows.

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor / Windsurf / Others |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Skills available | 61/61 | 61/61 |
| Mesh connections | 200+ (programmatic) | 200+ (rule references) |
| Workflows & HARD-GATEs | Full | Full |
| Extension packs | 14 | 14 |
| Subagent parallelism | Native | Sequential fallback |
| Lifecycle hooks | 8 hooks (JS runtime) | Inline MUST/NEVER constraints |
| Adaptive model routing | haiku/sonnet/opus | Single model |
| Mesh analytics | Real-time metrics | Not available |

**Same power, different delivery.** Claude Code gets execution efficiency; other IDEs get the same knowledge and workflows.

### Layer Rules

| Layer | Can Call | Called By | State |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| L0 Router | L1-L3 (routing) | Every message | Stateless |
| L1 Orchestrators | L2, L3 | L0, User | Stateful (workflow) |
| L2 Workflow Hubs | L2 (cross-hub), L3 | L1, L2 | Stateful (task) |
| L3 Utilities | Nothing (pure)* | L1, L2 | Stateless |
| L4 Extensions | L3 | L2 (domain match) | Config-based |

\*L3→L3 exceptions: `context-engine`→`session-bridge`, `hallucination-guard`→`research`, `session-bridge`→`integrity-check`

### Cost Intelligence

Every skill has an auto-selected model for optimal cost:

| Task Type | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Scan, search, validate | Haiku | Cheapest |
| Write code, fix bugs, review | Sonnet | Default |
| Architecture, security audit | Opus | Deep reasoning |

Typical feature: ~$0.05-0.15 (vs ~$0.60 all-opus).

## Key Workflows

### `/rune cook` — Build a Feature

```
Phase 0 RESUME     → detect existing .rune/plan-*.md, load active phase
Phase 1 UNDERSTAND → scout scans codebase, ba elicits requirements
Phase 2 PLAN       → plan creates master plan + phase files
Phase 3 TEST       → test writes failing tests (TDD red)
Phase 4 IMPLEMENT  → fix writes code (TDD green)
Phase 5 QUALITY    → preflight + sentinel + review (parallel)
Phase 6 VERIFY     → verification + hallucination-guard
Phase 7 COMMIT     → git creates semantic commit
Phase 8 BRIDGE     → session-bridge saves state, announce next phase
```

Multi-session: Phase 0 detects existing plans and resumes from the current phase. One phase per session = small context = better code.

### `/rune rescue` — Refactor Legacy Code

```
Phase 0 RECON      → autopsy assesses damage (health score)
Phase 1 SAFETY NET → safeguard writes characterization tests
Phase 2-N SURGERY  → surgeon refactors 1 module per session
Phase N+1 CLEANUP  → remove @legacy markers
Phase N+2 VERIFY   → health score comparison (before vs after)
```

### `/rune launch` — Deploy + Market

```
Phase 1 PRE-FLIGHT → full test suite
Phase 2 DEPLOY     → push to platform
Phase 3 VERIFY     → live site checks + monitoring
Phase 4 MARKET     → landing copy, social, SEO
Phase 5 ANNOUNCE   → publish content
```

## Mesh Resilience

If a skill fails, the mesh adapts:

| If this fails... | Rune tries... |
|---|---|
| debug can't find cause | problem-solver (different reasoning) |
| docs-seeker can't find docs | research (broader web search) |
| scout can't find files | research + docs-seeker |
| test can't run | deploy fix env, then test again |

Loop prevention: max 2 visits per skill, max chain depth 8.

## Cross-Session Persistence

Rune preserves context across sessions via `.rune/`:

```
.rune/
├── decisions.md     — architectural decisions log
├── conventions.md   — established patterns & style
├── progress.md      — task progress tracker
└── session-log.md   — brief session history
```

Every new session loads `.rune/` automatically — zero context loss.

## Extension Packs

**$149 lifetime** — [rune-kit/rune-business](https://github.com/rune-kit/rune-business)

## Multi-Platform Compiler

Rune includes a 3-stage compiler that transforms SKILL.md files into platform-native rule formats:

```
skills/*.md → PARSE → TRANSFORM → EMIT → platform rules
```

**8 transforms applied per platform:**
1. Frontmatter: strip Claude Code-specific directives
2. Cross-references: `rune:cook` → `@rune-cook.mdc` (Cursor) / prose ref (Windsurf)
3. Tool names: `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash` → generic language
4. Subagents: parallel → sequential workflow
5. Compliance: inject enforcement preamble (non-Claude platforms)
6. Hooks: runtime hooks → inline MUST/NEVER constraints
7. Branding: Rune attribution footer

```bash
# Build for any platform
npx @rune-kit/rune build --platform cursor
npx @rune-kit/rune build --platform windsurf

# Validate compiled output
npx @rune-kit/rune doctor
```

See [docs/MULTI-PLATFORM.md](docs/MULTI-PLATFORM.md) for the full architecture.
