# Rune

**Less skills. Deeper connections.**

A lean, interconnected skill ecosystem for AI coding assistants. 55 skills, 200+ mesh connections, full project lifecycle — from idea to production.

Works on **Claude Code** (native plugin) · **Cursor** · **Windsurf** · **Google Antigravity** · any AI IDE

## Why Rune?

Most skill ecosystems are either **too many isolated skills** (540+ that don't talk to each other) or **rigid pipelines** (A → B → C, if B fails everything stops).

Rune is a **mesh** — 55 skills with 200+ connections across a 5-layer architecture. Skills call each other bidirectionally, forming resilient workflows that adapt when things go wrong.

```
Pipeline:  A → B → C → D         (B fails = stuck)
Hub-Spoke: A → HUB → C           (HUB fails = stuck)
Mesh:      A ↔ B ↔ C             (B fails = A reaches C via D→E)
           ↕       ↕
           D ↔ E ↔ F
```

## What Rune Is (and Isn't)

Rune started as a **Claude Code plugin** and now compiles to **every major AI IDE**. Same 55 skills, same mesh connections, same workflows — zero knowledge loss across platforms.

| | Rune Provides | Claude Code Provides |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflows** | 8-phase TDD cycle (cook), parallel DAG execution (team), rescue pipelines | Basic tool calling |
| **Quality Gates** | preflight + sentinel + review + completion-gate (parallel) | None built-in |
| **Domain Knowledge** | 12 extension packs (trading, SaaS, mobile, etc.) | General-purpose |
| **Cross-Session State** | .rune/ directory (decisions, conventions, progress) | Conversation only |
| **Mesh Resilience** | 200+ skill connections, fail-loud-route-around | Linear execution |
| **Cost Optimization** | Auto model selection (haiku/sonnet/opus per task) | Single model |
| | | |
| **Sandbox & Permissions** | — | Claude Code handles this |
| **Agent Spawning** | — | Claude Code's Task/Agent system |
| **MCP Integration** | — | Claude Code's MCP protocol |
| **File System Access** | — | Claude Code's tool permissions |

### Common Misconceptions

| "Rune doesn't have..." | Reality |
|---|---|
| Task graph / DAG | `team` skill: DAG decomposition → parallel worktree agents → merge coordination |
| CI quality gates | `verification` skill: lint + typecheck + tests + build (actual commands, not LLM review) |
| Memory / state | `session-bridge` + `journal`: cross-session decisions, conventions, ADRs, module health |
| Multi-model strategy | Every skill has assigned model: haiku (scan), sonnet (code), opus (architecture) |
| Agent specialization | 55 specialized skills with dedicated roles (architect, coder, reviewer, scanner, researcher, BA, scaffolder) — each runs as a Task agent via Claude Code |
| Security scanning | `sentinel`: OWASP patterns, secret scanning, dependency audit. `sast`: static analysis |

## Install

### Claude Code (Native Plugin)

```bash
# Via Claude Code plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add rune-kit/rune
/plugin install rune@rune-kit
```

Full mesh: subagents, hooks, adaptive routing, mesh analytics.

### Cursor / Windsurf / Antigravity / Any IDE

```bash
# Compile Rune skills for your platform
npx @rune-kit/rune init

# Or specify platform explicitly
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform cursor
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform windsurf
npx @rune-kit/rune init --platform antigravity
```

This compiles all 55 skills into your IDE's rules format. Same knowledge, same workflows.

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor / Windsurf / Others |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Skills available | 55/55 | 55/55 |
| Mesh connections | 200+ (programmatic) | 200+ (rule references) |
| Workflows & HARD-GATEs | Full | Full |
| Extension packs | 12 | 12 |
| Subagent parallelism | Native | Sequential fallback |
| Lifecycle hooks | 8 hooks (JS runtime) | Inline MUST/NEVER constraints |
| Adaptive model routing | haiku/sonnet/opus | Single model |
| Mesh analytics | Real-time metrics | Not available |

**Same power, different delivery.** Claude Code gets execution efficiency; other IDEs get the same knowledge and workflows.

### Layer Rules

| Layer | Can Call | Called By | State |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| L0 Router | L1-L3 (routing) | Every message | Stateless |
| L1 Orchestrators | L2, L3 | L0, User | Stateful (workflow) |
| L2 Workflow Hubs | L2 (cross-hub), L3 | L1, L2 | Stateful (task) |
| L3 Utilities | Nothing (pure)* | L1, L2 | Stateless |
| L4 Extensions | L3 | L2 (domain match) | Config-based |

\*L3→L3 exceptions: `context-engine`→`session-bridge`, `hallucination-guard`→`research`, `session-bridge`→`integrity-check`

### Cost Intelligence

Every skill has an auto-selected model for optimal cost:

| Task Type | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Scan, search, validate | Haiku | Cheapest |
| Write code, fix bugs, review | Sonnet | Default |
| Architecture, security audit | Opus | Deep reasoning |

Typical feature: ~$0.05-0.15 (vs ~$0.60 all-opus).

## Key Workflows

### `/rune cook` — Build a Feature

```
Phase 1 UNDERSTAND → scout scans codebase
Phase 2 PLAN       → plan creates implementation steps
Phase 3 TEST       → test writes failing tests (TDD red)
Phase 4 IMPLEMENT  → fix writes code (TDD green)
Phase 5 QUALITY    → preflight + sentinel + review
Phase 6 VERIFY     → verification + hallucination-guard
Phase 7 COMMIT     → git commit with semantic message
Phase 8 BRIDGE     → session-bridge saves state
```

### `/rune rescue` — Refactor Legacy Code

```
Phase 0 RECON      → autopsy assesses damage (health score)
Phase 1 SAFETY NET → safeguard writes characterization tests
Phase 2-N SURGERY  → surgeon refactors 1 module per session
Phase N+1 CLEANUP  → remove @legacy markers
Phase N+2 VERIFY   → health score comparison (before vs after)
```

### `/rune launch` — Deploy + Market

```
Phase 1 PRE-FLIGHT → full test suite
Phase 2 DEPLOY     → push to platform
Phase 3 VERIFY     → live site checks + monitoring
Phase 4 MARKET     → landing copy, social, SEO
Phase 5 ANNOUNCE   → publish content
```

## Mesh Resilience

If a skill fails, the mesh adapts:

| If this fails... | Rune tries... |
|---|---|
| debug can't find cause | problem-solver (different reasoning) |
| docs-seeker can't find docs | research (broader web search) |
| scout can't find files | research + docs-seeker |
| test can't run | deploy fix env, then test again |

Loop prevention: max 2 visits per skill, max chain depth 8.

## Cross-Session Persistence

Rune preserves context across sessions via `.rune/`:

```
.rune/
├── decisions.md     — architectural decisions log
├── conventions.md   — established patterns & style
├── progress.md      — task progress tracker
└── session-log.md   — brief session history
```

Every new session loads `.rune/` automatically — zero context loss.

## Extension Packs

Coming soon. See [docs/plans/RUNE-PRO-PLAN.md](docs/plans/RUNE-PRO-PLAN.md) for the full roadmap.

## Multi-Platform Compiler

Rune includes a 3-stage compiler that transforms SKILL.md files into platform-native rule formats:

```
skills/*.md → PARSE → TRANSFORM → EMIT → platform rules
```

**6 transforms applied per platform:**
1. Cross-references: `rune:cook` → `@rune-cook.mdc` (Cursor) / prose ref (Windsurf)
2. Tool names: `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash` → generic language
3. Frontmatter: strip Claude Code-specific directives
4. Subagents: parallel → sequential workflow
5. Hooks: runtime hooks → inline MUST/NEVER constraints
6. Branding: Rune attribution footer

```bash
# Build for any platform
npx @rune-kit/rune build --platform cursor
npx @rune-kit/rune build --platform windsurf

# Validate compiled output
npx @rune-kit/rune doctor
```

See [docs/MULTI-PLATFORM.md](docs/MULTI-PLATFORM.md) for the full architecture.
