## Platform Constraints

- MUST NOT: Never run commands containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens. Scan all shell commands for secret patterns before execution.
- MUST: After editing JS/TS files, ensure code follows project formatting conventions (Prettier/ESLint).
- MUST: After editing .ts/.tsx files, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors).
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Auto-generate project context for AI sessions. Scans the codebase and creates a CLAUDE.md project config plus .rune/ state directory so every future session starts with full context. Saves 10-20 minutes of re-explaining per session on undocumented projects.

## Triggers

- `/rune onboard` — manual invocation on any project
- Called by `rescue` as Phase 0 (understand before refactoring)
- Auto-trigger: when no CLAUDE.md exists in project root

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): deep codebase scan — structure, frameworks, patterns, dependencies
- `autopsy` (L2): when project appears messy or undocumented — health assessment

## Called By (inbound)

- User: `/rune onboard` manual invocation
- `rescue` (L1): Phase 0 — understand legacy project before refactoring
- `cook` (L1): if no CLAUDE.md found, onboard first

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Full Scan
Invoke `the rune-scout rule` on the project root. Collect:
- Top-level directory structure (depth 2)
- All config files: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`
- Python environment markers: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `conda-meta/`, `.python-version`
- Entry point files: `main.*`, `index.*`, `app.*`, `server.*`
- Test directory names and test file patterns
- CI/CD config files: `.github/workflows/`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`
- README.md if present

Do not read every source file — scout gives the skeleton. Use read the file only on config files and entry points.

### Step 2 — Detect Tech Stack
From the scan output, determine with confidence:
- **Language**: TypeScript | JavaScript | Python | Rust | Go | other
- **Framework**: Next.js | Vite+React | SvelteKit | Express | FastAPI | Django | none | other
- **Package manager**: npm | pnpm | yarn | pip | poetry | cargo | go modules
- **Test framework**: Vitest | Jest | pytest | cargo test | go test | none
- **Build tool**: tsc | vite | webpack | esbuild | cargo | none
- **Linter/formatter**: ESLint | Biome | Ruff | Black | Clippy | none
- **Python environment** (if Python project): detect from project markers:
  - `.venv/` or `venv/` directory → venv
  - `poetry.lock` → poetry
  - `uv.lock` → uv
  - `.python-version` → pyenv
  - `conda-meta/` or `environment.yml` → conda
  - `Pipfile.lock` → pipenv
  - None found → none (note: recommend setting up a virtual environment)

If a field cannot be determined with confidence, write "unknown" — do not guess.

### Step 3 — Extract Conventions
Read 3–5 representative source files (pick files with the most connections in the project — typically the main module, a route/controller file, and a utility file). Extract:
- **Naming patterns**: camelCase | snake_case | PascalCase for files, functions, variables
- **Import style**: named imports | default imports | barrel files (index.ts)
- **Error handling pattern**: try/catch | Result type | error boundary | unhandled
- **State management**: React Context | Zustand | Redux | Svelte stores | none
- **API pattern**: REST | tRPC | GraphQL | SDK | none
- **Test structure**: co-located (`file.test.ts`) | separate directory (`tests/`) | none

Write extracted conventions as bullet points — be specific, not generic.

### Step 4 — Generate CLAUDE.md
Write/create the file to create `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. Populate every section using data from Steps 2–3. Do not leave template placeholders — if data is unknown, write "unknown" or omit the section. Use the template below as the exact structure.

If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, Read the file to load it first, then merge — preserve any human-written sections (comments starting with `<!-- manual -->`) and update auto-detected sections only.

### Step 5 — Initialize .rune/ Directory
Run a shell command to create the directory: `mkdir -p .rune`

Write/create the file to create each file:
- `.rune/conventions.md` — paste the extracted conventions from Step 3 in full detail
- `.rune/decisions.md` — create with header `# Architecture Decisions` and one placeholder row in a markdown table (Date | Decision | Rationale | Status)
- `.rune/progress.md` — create with header `# Progress Log` and one placeholder entry
- `.rune/session-log.md` — create with header `# Session Log` and current date as first entry

### Step 6b — Generate DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md

Use the data from Steps 2–3 to generate `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` — a human-readable onboarding guide for new team members joining the project. This is NOT AI context. This is plain English for humans.

Write/create the file to create `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` with this template:

```markdown
# Developer Guide: [Project Name]

## What This Does
[2 sentences max. What problem does this project solve? Who uses it?]

## Quick Setup
[Copy-paste commands to get from zero to running locally]
```bash
# [Python projects] Activate virtual environment
[detected activation command — e.g., source .venv/bin/activate | poetry shell | uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate]

# Install dependencies
[detected command — e.g., pip install -e ".[dev]" | poetry install | npm install]

# Run development server
[detected command]

# Run tests
[detected command]
```

## Key Files
[5–10 most important files with one-line description each]
- `[path]` — [what it does]

## How to Contribute
1. Fork or branch from main
2. Make changes, run tests: `[test command]`
3. Open a PR — describe what and why

## Common Issues
[Top 3 "it doesn't work" situations with fixes. Only include issues you can infer from the codebase — e.g., missing .env, wrong Node version, database not running]

[Python projects — always include these if applicable:]
- **ModuleNotFoundError** → Virtual environment not activated. Run: `[activation command]`
- **ImportError: cannot import name X** → Dependencies outdated. Run: `[install command]`
- **PYTHONPATH issues** → If using src layout, install in editable mode: `pip install -e .`

## Who to Ask
[If git log reveals consistent contributors, list them. Otherwise omit this section.]
```

If `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` already exists, skip and log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md — manual content preserved."

### Step 6c — Suggest L4 Extension Packs

Based on the detected tech stack from Step 2, recommend relevant L4 extension packs. Use the mapping table below to find applicable packs. Only suggest packs that match the detected stack — do not suggest all packs.

| Detected Stack | Suggest Pack | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SvelteKit | `@rune/ui` | Frontend component patterns, design system, accessibility audit |
| Express, Fastify, FastAPI, Django, NestJS, Go HTTP | `@rune/backend` | API patterns, auth flows, middleware, rate limiting |
| Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD config | `@rune/devops` | Container patterns, deployment pipelines, infrastructure as code |
| React Native, Expo, Flutter, SwiftUI | `@rune/mobile` | Mobile architecture, navigation patterns, offline sync |
| Security-focused codebase (auth, payments, HIPAA/PCI markers) | `@rune/security` | Threat modeling, OWASP flows, compliance patterns |
| Trading, finance, pricing, portfolio, market data | `@rune/trading` | Market data validation, risk calculation, backtesting patterns |
| Subscription billing, tenant isolation, feature flags | `@rune/saas` | Multi-tenancy, billing integration, feature flag patterns |
| Cart, checkout, product catalog, inventory, payments | `@rune/ecommerce` | Cart patterns, payment flows, inventory management |
| ML models, training pipelines, embeddings, LLM integration | `@rune/ai-ml` | Model evaluation, prompt patterns, inference optimization |
| Game loop, physics, entity systems, multiplayer | `@rune/gamedev` | Game architecture, ECS patterns, netcode |
| CMS, blog, newsletter, SEO, content workflows | `@rune/content` | Content modeling, SEO patterns, editorial workflows |
| Analytics, dashboards, metrics, data pipelines, BI | `@rune/analytics` | Data modeling, visualization patterns, pipeline architecture |

If 0 packs match: omit this section from the report (no suggestions is correct for a generic project).

**Community pack discovery**: Also check if `.rune/community-packs/registry.json` exists. If it does, list installed community packs alongside core pack suggestions. If community packs are installed, include them under a `### Installed Community Packs` subsection.

If ≥1 packs match: include in the Onboard Report under a `### Suggested L4 Packs` section:

```
### Suggested L4 Packs
Based on your detected stack ([detected frameworks]), these extension packs may be useful:

- **@rune/[pack]** — [one-line reason based on detected stack]
  Install: [link or command when available]
```

### Step 7 — Commit
Run a shell command to stage and commit the generated files:
```bash
git add CLAUDE.md .rune/ && git commit -m "chore: initialize rune project context"
```

If `git` is not available or the directory is not a git repo, skip this step and add an INFO note to the report: "Not a git repository — files written but not committed."

If any of the `.rune/` files already exist, do not overwrite them (they may contain human-written decisions). Log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .rune/[file] — manual content preserved."

## CLAUDE.md Template

```

## Constraints

1. MUST scan actual project files — never generate CLAUDE.md from assumptions
2. MUST detect and respect existing CLAUDE.md content — merge, don't overwrite
3. MUST include: build commands, test commands, lint commands, project structure
4. MUST NOT include obvious/generic advice ("write clean code", "use meaningful names")
5. MUST verify generated commands actually work by running them
6. MUST NOT overwrite existing .rune/ files — always preserve human-written content

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md generated from README alone (no file scan) | CRITICAL | Step 1 MUST invoke scout — never skip actual file scanning |
| DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md contains generic placeholder text not derived from project | HIGH | Every section must reference actual detected commands, files, and patterns — no generic advice |
| Overwriting existing .rune/ files with manual content | CRITICAL | Check file existence before every Write — skip and log INFO if exists |
| Common Issues section fabricated (no actual issues detected) | MEDIUM | Only list issues inferable from codebase (missing .env, Node version, etc.) — omit section if none found |

## Done When

- CLAUDE.md written (or merged) with all detected tech stack fields populated
- .rune/ directory initialized with conventions, decisions, progress, session-log
- .rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md written with setup commands from actual scan
- All generated commands verified to exist in package.json/Makefile/etc.
- Onboard Report emitted with Generated + Skipped + Observations sections

## Cost Profile

~2000-5000 tokens input, ~1000-2000 tokens output. Sonnet for analysis quality.
