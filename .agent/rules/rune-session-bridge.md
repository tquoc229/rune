## Platform Constraints

- MUST: After editing JS/TS files, ensure code follows project formatting conventions (Prettier/ESLint).
- MUST: After editing .ts/.tsx files, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors).
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Solve the #1 developer complaint: context loss across sessions. Session-bridge auto-saves critical context to `.rune/` files in the project directory, and loads them at session start. Every new session knows exactly where the last one left off.

## Triggers

- Auto-trigger: when an architectural decision is made
- Auto-trigger: when a convention/pattern is established
- Auto-trigger: before context compaction
- Auto-trigger: at session end (stop hook)
- `/rune status` — manual state check

## Calls (outbound)

# Exception: L3→L3 coordination (same pattern as hallucination-guard → research)
- `integrity-check` (L3): verify .rune/ file integrity before loading state

## Called By (inbound)

- `cook` (L1): auto-save decisions during feature implementation
- `rescue` (L1): state management throughout refactoring
- `context-engine` (L3): save state before compaction

## State Files Managed

```
.rune/
├── decisions.md      — Architectural decisions log
├── conventions.md    — Established patterns & style
├── progress.md       — Task progress tracker
└── session-log.md    — Brief log of each session
```

## Execution

### Save Mode (end of session or pre-compaction)

#### Step 1 — Gather state

Collect from the current session:
- All architectural or technology choices made (language, library, approach)
- Conventions established (naming patterns, file structure, coding style)
- Tasks completed, in-progress, and blocked
- A one-paragraph summary of what this session accomplished

**Python project context** (if `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` detected):
- Python version (from `.python-version`, `pyproject.toml` `requires-python`, or `python --version`)
- Virtual environment path and type (venv, poetry, uv, conda)
- Installed optional dependency groups (e.g., `[dev]`, `[test]`, `[embeddings]`)
- Last mypy error count (from most recent verification run, if available)
- Last test coverage percentage (from most recent test run, if available)
- DB migration version (if alembic, django migrations, or similar detected)

#### Step 2 — Update .rune/decisions.md

Find files by pattern to check if `.rune/decisions.md` exists. If not, Write/create the file to create it with a `# Decisions Log` header.

For each architectural decision from this session, Edit the file to append to `.rune/decisions.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Decision: <title>

**Context:** Why this decision was needed
**Decision:** What was decided
**Rationale:** Why this approach over alternatives
**Impact:** What files/modules are affected
```

#### Step 3 — Update .rune/conventions.md

Find files by pattern to check if `.rune/conventions.md` exists. If not, Write/create the file to create it with a `# Conventions` header.

For each pattern or convention established, Edit the file to append to `.rune/conventions.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Convention: <title>

**Pattern:** Description of the convention
**Example:** Code example showing the pattern
**Applies to:** Where this convention should be followed
```

Python example:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Convention: Async-First I/O

**Pattern:** All I/O functions use `async def`; blocking calls (`requests`, `open`, `time.sleep`) are forbidden in async modules
**Example:** `async def fetch_data(): async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: ...`
**Applies to:** All modules in `src/` — sync wrappers only in CLI entry points
```

#### Step 4 — Update .rune/progress.md

Find files by pattern to check if `.rune/progress.md` exists. If not, Write/create the file to create it with a `# Progress` header.

Edit the file to append the current task status to `.rune/progress.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Session Summary

**Completed:**
- [x] Task description

**In Progress:**
- [ ] Task description (step X/Y)

**Blocked:**
- [ ] Task description — reason

**Next Session Should:**
- Start with X
- Continue Y from step Z

**Python Context** (if Python project):
- Python: [version] ([venv type])
- Installed extras: [list of optional dependency groups]
- mypy: [error count] ([strict/normal])
- Coverage: [percentage]%
- Migration: [version or N/A]
```

#### Step 5 — Update .rune/session-log.md

Find files by pattern to check if `.rune/session-log.md` exists. If not, Write/create the file to create it with a `# Session Log` header.

Edit the file to append a one-line entry to `.rune/session-log.md`:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — [brief description of session accomplishments]
```

#### Step 6 — Cross-Project Knowledge Extraction (Neural Memory Bridge)

Before committing, extract generalizable patterns from this session for cross-project reuse:

1. Review the session's decisions, conventions, and completed tasks
2. Identify 1-3 patterns that are NOT project-specific but would help in OTHER projects:
   - Technology choices with reasoning ("Chose Redis over Memcached because X")
   - Architecture patterns ("Fan-out queue pattern solved Y")
   - Failure modes discovered ("React 19 useEffect cleanup breaks when Z")
   - Performance insights ("N+1 query pattern in Prisma solved by include")
3. For each generalizable pattern, save to Neural Memory:
   - Use `nmem_remember` with rich cognitive language (causal, comparative, decisional)
   - Tags: `[cross-project, <technology>, <pattern-type>]`
   - Priority: 6-7 (important enough to surface in other projects)
4. Skip if session was purely project-specific (config changes, bug fixes with no transferable insight)

**Why**: This turns every project session into learning that compounds across ALL projects. A pattern discovered in Project A auto-surfaces when Project B faces a similar problem.

#### Step 7 — Commit

Stage and commit all updated state files:

```bash
git add .rune/ && git commit -m "chore: update rune session state"
```

If git is not available or the directory is not a repo, skip the commit and emit a warning.

---

### Load Mode (start of session)

#### Step 1 — Check existence

Find files by pattern to check for `.rune/` directory:

```
Glob pattern: .rune/*.md
```

If no files found: suggest running `/rune onboard` to initialize the project. Exit load mode.

#### Step 1.5 — Integrity verification

Before loading state files, invoke `integrity-check` (L3) to verify `.rune/` files haven't been tampered:

```
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: the rune-integrity-check rule
→ Invoke integrity-check on all .rune/*.md files found in Step 1.
→ Capture: status (CLEAN | SUSPICIOUS | TAINTED), findings list.
```

Handle results:
- `CLEAN` → proceed to Step 2 (load files)
- `SUSPICIOUS` → present warning to user with specific findings. Ask: "Suspicious patterns detected in .rune/ files. Load anyway?" If user approves → proceed. If not → exit load mode.
- `TAINTED` → **BLOCK load**. Report: ".rune/ integrity check FAILED — possible poisoning detected. Run `/rune integrity` for details."

#### Step 2 — Load files

Use read the file on all four state files in parallel:

```
Read: .rune/decisions.md
Read: .rune/conventions.md
Read: .rune/progress.md
Read: .rune/session-log.md
```

#### Step 3 — Summarize

Present the loaded context to the agent in a structured summary:

> "Here's what happened in previous sessions:"
> - Last session: [last line from session-log.md]
> - Key decisions: [last 3 entries from decisions.md]
> - Active conventions: [count from conventions.md]
> - Current progress: [in-progress and blocked items from progress.md]
> - Next task: [first item under "Next Session Should" from progress.md]

#### Step 4 — Resume

Identify the next concrete task from `progress.md` → "Next Session Should" section. Present it as the recommended starting point to the calling orchestrator.

## Output Format

### Save Mode
```
## Session Bridge — Saved
- **decisions.md**: [N] decisions appended
- **conventions.md**: [N] conventions appended
- **progress.md**: updated (completed/in-progress/blocked counts)
- **session-log.md**: 1 entry appended
- **Git commit**: [hash] | skipped (no git)
```

### Load Mode
```
## Session Bridge — Loaded
- **Last session**: [date and summary]
- **Decisions on file**: [count]
- **Conventions on file**: [count]
- **Next task**: [task description]
```

## Constraints

1. MUST save decisions, conventions, and progress — not just a status line
2. MUST verify saved context can be loaded in a fresh session — test the round-trip
3. MUST NOT overwrite existing bridge data without merging

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Overwriting existing .rune/ files instead of appending | HIGH | Constraint 3: use Edit to append entries — never Write to overwrite existing state |
| Saving only a status line, missing decisions/conventions | HIGH | Constraint 1: all three files (decisions, conventions, progress) must be updated |
| Load mode presenting stale context without age marker | MEDIUM | Mark each loaded entry with its session date — caller knows how fresh it is |
| Silent failure when git unavailable | MEDIUM | Note "no git available" in report — do not fail silently or skip without logging |
| Loading poisoned .rune/ files without verification | CRITICAL | Step 1.5 integrity-check MUST run before loading — TAINTED = block load |

## Done When (Save Mode)

- decisions.md updated with all architectural decisions made this session
- conventions.md updated with all new patterns established
- progress.md updated with completed/in-progress/blocked task status
- session-log.md appended with one-line session summary
- Git commit made (or "no git" noted in report)
- Session Bridge Saved report emitted

## Done When (Load Mode)

- .rune/*.md files found and read
- Last session summary presented
- Current in-progress and blocked tasks identified
- Next task recommendation from progress.md
- Session Bridge Loaded report emitted

## Cost Profile

~100-300 tokens per save. ~500-1000 tokens per load. Always haiku. Negligible cost.
