# verification

Runs all automated checks to verify code health. Stateless — runs checks and reports results.

## Platform Constraints

- MUST NOT: Never run commands containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens. Scan all shell commands for secret patterns before execution.
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Detect Project Type

Find files by pattern to find project config files:

1. Check for `package.json` → Node.js/TypeScript project
2. Check for `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` → Python project
3. Check for `Cargo.toml` → Rust project
4. Check for `go.mod` → Go project
5. Check for `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` → Java project

Use read the file on the detected config file to find scripts or tool config (e.g., `package.json` scripts block for custom lint/test commands).

```
TodoWrite: [
  { content: "Detect project type", status: "in_progress" },
  { content: "Run lint check", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Run type check", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Run test suite", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Run build", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Generate verification report", status: "pending" }
]
```

### Phase 2: Run Lint

Run a shell command to run the appropriate linter. If `package.json` has a `lint` script, prefer that:

- **Node.js (npm lint script)**: `npm run lint`
- **Node.js (no script)**: `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0`
- **Python**: `ruff check .` (fallback: `flake8 .`)
- **Rust**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Go**: `golangci-lint run` (fallback: `go vet ./...`)

If lint fails: record the failure output, mark lint as FAIL, continue to next step. Do NOT stop.

**Verification gate**: Command exits without crashing (even if it reports lint errors — those are FAIL, not errors).

### Phase 3: Run Type Check

Run in the terminal:

- **TypeScript**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Python**: `mypy .` (fallback: `pyright .`)
- **Rust**: `cargo check`
- **Go**: `go vet ./...`

If type check fails: record error count and first 10 error lines, mark as FAIL, continue.

### Phase 4: Run Tests

Run a shell command to run the test suite. Prefer the project script if available:

- **Node.js (npm test script)**: `npm test`
- **Vitest**: `npx vitest run`
- **Jest**: `npx jest --passWithNoTests`
- **Python**: `pytest -v` (fallback: `python -m unittest discover`)
- **Rust**: `cargo test`
- **Go**: `go test ./...`

Record: total tests, passed count, failed count, coverage percentage if output includes it.

If tests fail: record which tests failed (first 20), mark as FAIL, continue to build.

### Phase 5: Run Build

Run in the terminal:

- **Node.js**: check `package.json` for `build` script → `npm run build` (fallback: `npx tsc`)
- **Python**: check `pyproject.toml` for `[build-system]` section:
  - If build backend found (setuptools, poetry-core, hatchling, flit-core): `python -m build --no-isolation 2>&1 | head -20` to verify packaging
  - If `setup.py` exists (legacy): `python setup.py check --strict`
  - Then always: `pip install -e . --dry-run` to catch broken entry points, missing `__init__.py`, or import path issues
  - If no `pyproject.toml` and no `setup.py` (scripts-only project): SKIP
- **Rust**: `cargo build`
- **Go**: `go build ./...`

If build fails: record first 20 lines of build output, mark as FAIL.

### Phase 6: Generate Report

Compile all results into the structured report. Update all TodoWrite items to completed.

## Error Recovery

- If project type cannot be detected: report "Unknown project type" and skip all checks
- If a command is not found (e.g., `ruff` not installed): note "tool not installed", mark check as SKIP
- If a command hangs for more than 60 seconds: kill it, mark check as TIMEOUT, continue

## Calls (outbound)

None — pure runner using Bash for all checks. Does not invoke other skills.

## Called By (inbound)

- `cook` (L1): Phase 6 VERIFY — final check before commit
- `fix` (L2): validate fix doesn't break existing functionality
- `test` (L2): validate test coverage meets threshold
- `deploy` (L2): post-deploy health checks
- `sentinel` (L2): run security audit tools (npm audit, etc.)
- `safeguard` (L2): verify safety net is solid before refactoring
- `db` (L2): run migration in test environment
- `perf` (L2): run benchmark scripts if configured
- `skill-forge` (L2): verify newly created skill passes lint/type/build checks

## Output Format

```
VERIFICATION REPORT
===================
Lint:      [PASS/FAIL/SKIP] ([details])
Types:     [PASS/FAIL/SKIP] ([X errors])
Tests:     [PASS/FAIL/SKIP] ([passed]/[total], [coverage]%)
Build:     [PASS/FAIL/SKIP]

Overall:   [PASS/FAIL]

### Failures (if any)
- Lint: [error details with file:line]
- Types: [first 5 type errors]
- Tests: [first 5 failing test names]
- Build: [first 5 build errors]
```

## Evidence-Before-Claims Gate

<HARD-GATE>
An agent MUST NOT claim "done", "fixed", "passing", or "verified" without showing the actual command output that proves it.
"I ran the tests and they pass" WITHOUT stdout/stderr = UNVERIFIED CLAIM = REJECTED.
The verification report IS the evidence. No report = no verification happened.
</HARD-GATE>

### Claim Validation Protocol

When any skill calls verification and then reports results upstream:

1. **Output capture is mandatory** — every Bash command's stdout/stderr must appear in the report
2. **Pass requires proof** — PASS means "tool ran AND output shows zero errors" (not "tool ran without crashing")
3. **Silence is not success** — if a command produces no output, note it explicitly ("0 errors, 0 warnings")
4. **Partial runs are labeled** — if only 2 of 4 checks ran, Overall = INCOMPLETE (not PASS)

### Red Flags — Agent is Lying

| Claim | Without | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| "All tests pass" | Test runner stdout showing pass count | REJECTED — re-run and show output |
| "No lint errors" | Linter stdout | REJECTED — re-run and show output |
| "Build succeeds" | Build command stdout | REJECTED — re-run and show output |
| "I verified it" | Verification Report | REJECTED — run verification skill properly |
| "Fixed and working" | Before/after test output | REJECTED — show the diff in results |

## Constraints

1. MUST run ALL four checks: lint, type-check, tests, build — not just tests
2. MUST show actual command output — never claim "all passed" without evidence
3. MUST report specific failures with file:line references
4. MUST NOT skip checks because "changes are small"
5. MUST include stdout/stderr capture in every check result — empty output noted explicitly
6. MUST mark Overall as INCOMPLETE if any check was skipped without valid reason (tool not installed = valid, "changes are small" = invalid)

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Claiming "all passed" without showing actual command output | CRITICAL | Evidence-Before-Claims HARD-GATE blocks this — stdout/stderr is mandatory |
| Agent says "verified" without producing Verification Report | CRITICAL | No report = no verification. Re-run the skill properly. |
| Skipping build because "changes are small" | HIGH | Constraint 4: all four checks mandatory — size of changes doesn't matter |
| Marking check as PASS when the tool isn't installed | MEDIUM | Mark as SKIP (not PASS) — PASS means the tool ran and reported clean |
| Stopping after first failure instead of running remaining checks | MEDIUM | Run all checks; aggregate all failures so developer can fix everything at once |
| Reporting PASS when output has warnings but zero errors | LOW | PASS is correct but note warning count — caller decides if warnings matter |

## Done When

- Project type detected from config files
- lint, type-check, tests, and build all executed (or SKIP with reason if tool missing)
- Each check shows actual command output
- Failures include specific file:line references (not just counts)
- Verification Report emitted with Overall PASS/FAIL verdict

## Cost Profile

~$0.01-0.03 per run. Haiku + Bash commands. Fast and cheap.
