## Live Routing Context

Routing overrides (if available): !`cat .rune/metrics/routing-overrides.json 2>/dev/null || echo "No adaptive routing rules active."`

Recent skill usage: !`cat .rune/metrics/skills.json 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No metrics collected yet."`

# skill-router

## Platform Constraints

- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

The missing enforcement layer for Rune. While individual skills have HARD-GATEs and constraints, nothing forces the agent to *check* for the right skill before acting. `skill-router` fixes this by intercepting every user request and routing it through the correct skill(s) before any code is written, any file is read, or any clarifying question is asked.

This is L0 — it sits above L1 orchestrators. It doesn't do work itself; it ensures the right skill does the work.

## Triggers

- **ALWAYS** — This skill is conceptually active on every user message
- Loaded via system prompt or plugin description, not invoked manually
- The agent MUST internalize this routing table and apply it before every response

## Calls (outbound connections)

- Any skill (L1-L3): routes to the correct skill based on intent detection

## Called By (inbound connections)

- None — this is the entry point. Nothing calls skill-router; it IS the first check.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Check Routing Overrides (H3 Adaptive Routing)

Before standard routing, check if adaptive routing rules exist:

1. Use read the file on `.rune/metrics/routing-overrides.json`
2. If the file exists and has active rules, scan each rule's `condition` against the current user intent
3. If a rule matches:
   - Apply the override action (e.g., "route to problem-solver before debug")
   - Log: "Adaptive routing: applying rule [id] — [action]"
4. If no file exists or no rules match, proceed to standard routing (Step 1)

**Override constraints**:
- Overrides MUST NOT bypass layer discipline (L3 cannot call L1)
- Overrides MUST NOT skip quality gates (sentinel, preflight, verification)
- Overrides MUST NOT route to non-existent skills
- If an override seems wrong, announce it and let user decide to keep or disable

**Model hint support** (Adaptive Model Re-balancing):
- Override entries may include `"model_hint": "opus"` — this signals that a skill previously failed at sonnet-level and needed opus reasoning depth
- When a model_hint is present, announce: "Adaptive routing: this skill previously required opus-level reasoning for [context]. Escalating model."
- Model hints are written by cook Phase 8 when debug-fix loops hit max retries on the same error pattern
- Model hints do NOT override explicit user model preferences

### Step 0.5 — STOP before responding

Before generating ANY response (including clarifying questions), the agent MUST:

1. **Classify the user's intent** using the routing table below
2. **Identify which skill(s) match** — if even 1% chance a skill applies, invoke it
3. **Invoke the skill** via the Skill tool
4. **Follow the skill's instructions** — the skill dictates the workflow, not the agent

### Step 1 — Intent Classification (Progressive Disclosure)

Skills are organized into 3 tiers for discoverability. **Tier 1 skills handle 90% of user requests.**

#### Tier 1 — Primary Entry Points (User-Facing)

These 5 skills are the main interface. Most user intents route here first:

| User Intent | Route To | When |
|---|---|---|
| Build / implement / add feature / fix bug | `the rune-cook rule` | Any code change request |
| Large multi-part task / parallel work | `the rune-team rule` | 5+ files or 3+ modules |
| Deploy + launch + marketing | `the rune-launch rule` | Ship to production |
| Legacy code / rescue / modernize | `the rune-rescue rule` | Old/messy codebase |
| Check project health / full audit | `the rune-audit rule` | Quality assessment |
| New project / bootstrap / scaffold | `the rune-scaffold rule` | Greenfield project creation |

**Default route**: If unclear, route to `the rune-cook rule`. Cook handles 70% of all requests.

#### Tier 2 — Power User Skills (Direct Invocation)

For users who know exactly what they want:

| User Intent | Route To | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Plan / design / architect | `the rune-plan rule` | L2 — requires opus |
| Brainstorm / explore ideas | `the rune-brainstorm rule` | L2 — before plan |
| Review code / check quality | `the rune-review rule` | L2 |
| Write tests | `the rune-test rule` | L2 — TDD |
| Refactor | `the rune-surgeon rule` | L2 — incremental |
| Deploy (without marketing) | `the rune-deploy rule` | L2 |
| Security concern | `the rune-sentinel rule` | L2 — opus for critical |
| Performance issue | `the rune-perf rule` | L2 |
| Database change | `the rune-db rule` | L2 |
| Received code review / PR feedback | `the rune-review-intake rule` | L2 |
| Protect / audit / document business logic | `the rune-logic-guardian rule` | L2 |
| Create / edit a Rune skill | `the rune-skill-forge rule` | L2 — requires opus |
| Incident / outage | `the rune-incident rule` | L2 |
| UI/UX design | `the rune-design rule` | L2 |
| Fix bug / debug only (no fix) | `the rune-debug rule` → `the rune-fix rule` | L2 chain |
| Marketing assets only | `the rune-marketing rule` | L2 |
| Gather requirements / BA / elicit needs | `the rune-ba rule` | L2 — requires opus |
| Generate / update docs | `the rune-docs rule` | L2 |
| Build MCP server | `the rune-mcp-builder rule` | L2 |
| Red-team / challenge a plan / stress-test | `the rune-adversary rule` | L2 — requires opus |

#### Tier 3 — Internal Skills (Called by Other Skills)

These are rarely invoked directly — they're called by Tier 1/2 skills:

| Skill | Called By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `the rune-scout rule` | cook, plan, team | Codebase scanning |
| `the rune-fix rule` | debug, cook | Apply code changes |
| `the rune-preflight rule` | cook | Quality gate |
| `the rune-verification rule` | cook, fix | Run lint/test/build |
| `the rune-hallucination-guard rule` | cook, fix | Verify imports |
| `the rune-completion-gate rule` | cook | Validate claims |
| `the rune-sentinel-env rule` | cook, scaffold, onboard | Environment pre-flight |
| `the rune-research rule` / `the rune-docs-seeker rule` | any | Look up docs |
| `the rune-session-bridge rule` | cook, team | Save context (in-session state handoff) |
| `the rune-journal rule` | cook, team | Persistent work log within a session |
| `the rune-neural-memory rule` | cook, team, any L1/L2 | Cross-session cognitive persistence via Neural Memory MCP — semantic complement to session-bridge and journal |
| `the rune-git rule` | cook, scaffold, team, launch | Semantic commits, PRs, branches |
| `the rune-doc-processor rule` | docs, marketing | PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX generation |
| "Done" / "ship it" / "xong" | — | `the rune-verification rule` → commit |
| "recall", "remember", "brain", "nmem", "cross-project memory" | `the rune-neural-memory rule` | Retrieve or persist cross-session context |

#### Tier 4 — Domain Extension Packs (L4)

When user intent matches a domain-specific pattern or user explicitly invokes an L4 trigger command, route to the L4 pack. The agent reads the pack's PACK.md and follows the matching skill's workflow.

| User Intent / Domain Signal | Route To | Pack File |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend UI, design system, a11y, animation | `@rune/ui` | `extensions/ui/PACK.md` |
| API design, auth, middleware, rate limiting | `@rune/backend` | `extensions/backend/PACK.md` |
| Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, server setup | `@rune/devops` | `extensions/devops/PACK.md` |
| React Native, Flutter, mobile app, app store | `@rune/mobile` | `extensions/mobile/PACK.md` |
| OWASP, pentest, secrets, compliance | `@rune/security` | `extensions/security/PACK.md` |
| Trading, fintech, charts, market data | `@rune/trading` | `extensions/trading/PACK.md` |
| Multi-tenant, billing, SaaS subscription | `@rune/saas` | `extensions/saas/PACK.md` |
| Shopify, payments, cart, inventory | `@rune/ecommerce` | `extensions/ecommerce/PACK.md` |
| LLM, RAG, embeddings, fine-tuning | `@rune/ai-ml` | `extensions/ai-ml/PACK.md` |
| Three.js, WebGL, game loop, physics | `@rune/gamedev` | `extensions/gamedev/PACK.md` |
| Blog, CMS, MDX, i18n, SEO | `@rune/content` | `extensions/content/PACK.md` |
| Analytics, A/B testing, funnels, dashboards | `@rune/analytics` | `extensions/analytics/PACK.md` |

**L4 routing rules:**
1. If user explicitly invokes an L4 trigger (e.g., `/rune rag-patterns`), read the PACK.md and follow the skill workflow directly
2. If the intent also involves implementation, route to `cook` (L1) first — cook will detect L4 context in Phase 1.5
3. L4 packs supplement L1/L2 workflows — they are domain knowledge, not standalone orchestrators
4. L4 packs can call L3 utilities (scout, verification) but CANNOT call L1 or L2 skills
5. If the L4 pack file is not found on disk, skip silently and proceed with standard routing

### Step 2 — Compound Intent Resolution

Many requests combine intents. Route to the HIGHEST-PRIORITY skill first:

```
Priority: L1 > L2 > L3
Within same layer: process skills > implementation skills

Example: "Add auth and deploy it"
  → the rune-cook rule (add auth) FIRST
  → the rune-deploy rule SECOND (after cook completes)

Example: "Fix the login bug and add tests"
  → the rune-debug rule (diagnose) FIRST
  → the rune-fix rule (apply fix) SECOND
  → the rune-test rule (add tests) THIRD

L4 integration: If cook is the primary route AND a domain pack matches,
cook handles orchestration while the L4 pack provides domain patterns.
Both are active — cook for workflow, L4 for domain knowledge.
```

### Step 3 — Anti-Rationalization Gate

The agent MUST NOT bypass routing with these excuses:

| Thought | Reality | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "This is too simple for a skill" | Simple tasks still benefit from structure | Route it |
| "I already know how to do this" | Skills have constraints you'll miss | Route it |
| "Let me just read the file first" | Skills tell you HOW to read | Route first |
| "I need more context before routing" | Route first, skill will gather context | Route it |
| "The user just wants a quick answer" | Quick answers can still be wrong | Check routing table |
| "No skill matches exactly" | Pick closest match, or use scout + plan | Route it |
| "I'll apply the skill patterns mentally" | Mental application misses constraints | Actually invoke it |
| "This is just a follow-up" | Follow-ups can change intent | Re-check routing |

### Step 4 — Execute

Once routed:
1. Announce: "Using `rune:<skill>` to [purpose]"
2. Invoke the skill via Skill tool
3. Follow the skill's workflow exactly
4. If the skill has a checklist/phases, track via TodoWrite

### Step 5 — Post-Completion Neural Memory Capture

After ANY L1 or L2 workflow completes (cook, team, launch, rescue, scaffold, plan, design, debug, fix, review, deploy, sentinel, perf, db, ba, docs, mcp-builder, etc.):

1. Trigger `the rune-neural-memory rule` in **Capture Mode** automatically
2. Save 2–5 memories covering: key decisions made, bugs fixed, patterns applied, architectural choices
3. Use rich cognitive language (causal, temporal, decisional) — NOT flat facts
4. Tag memories with [project-name, skill-used, topic]
5. This step is MANDATORY even if the user did not ask for it
6. Exception: skip if the workflow produced zero technical output (e.g., only a clarifying question was asked)

**Capture Mode trigger phrase**: "Session artifact — capturing to Neural Memory."

## Routing Exceptions

These DO NOT need skill routing:
- Pure conversational responses ("hello", "thanks")
- Answering questions about Rune itself (meta-questions)
- Single-line factual answers with no code impact
- Resuming an already-active skill workflow

## Output Format

```
## Routing Decision
- **Intent**: [classified user intent]
- **Skill**: rune:[skill-name]
- **Confidence**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **Override**: [routing override applied, if any]
- **Reason**: [one-line justification for skill selection]
```

For multi-skill chains:
```
## Routing Chain
1. rune:[skill-1] — [purpose]
2. rune:[skill-2] — [purpose]
3. rune:[skill-3] — [purpose]
```

## Constraints

1. MUST check routing table before EVERY response that involves code, files, or technical decisions
2. MUST invoke skill via Skill tool — "mentally applying" a skill is NOT acceptable
3. MUST NOT write code without routing through at least one skill first
4. MUST NOT skip routing because "it's faster" — speed without correctness wastes more time
5. MUST re-route on intent change — if user shifts from "plan" to "implement", switch skills
6. MUST announce which skill is being used and why — transparency builds trust
7. MUST follow skill's internal workflow, not override it with own judgment

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent writes code without invoking any skill | CRITICAL | Constraint 3: code REQUIRES skill routing. No exceptions. |
| Agent "mentally applies" skill without invoking | HIGH | Constraint 2: must use Skill tool for full content |
| Routes to wrong skill, wastes a full workflow | MEDIUM | Step 2 compound resolution + re-route on mismatch |
| Over-routing trivial tasks (e.g., "what time is it") | LOW | Routing Exceptions section covers non-technical queries |
| Skill invocation adds latency to simple tasks | LOW | Acceptable trade-off: correctness > speed |

## Done When

- This skill is never "done" — it's a persistent routing layer
- Success = every agent response passes through routing check
- Failure = any code written without skill invocation

## Cost Profile

~0 tokens (routing logic is internalized from this document). Cost comes from the skills it routes to, not from skill-router itself. The routing table is loaded once and cached in context.
